I have created a waste management website ,its features are, after signing in as a citizen you get your QR code for your waste disposal bin, user can request garbage collection at any date, that date is displayed in user calendar in his profile, user can request garbage collection of two types, one for recycle, one for organic(biodegradable), that data is also shown in user profile through a pie-chart , user gets incentive for giving garbage in a good ratio of recycle and organic which is displayed in his profile. Website has another portal for garbage collector, after signing in as garbage collector, he can see the list of requests made by citizens, and a list of the citizens whom garbage collection request have been approved, this portal has a qr code scanner to scan the qr code of citizen's profile, after scanning, it approves the request of garbage collection by a citizen. This is my website , I want you to write some content for my website, and elaborate the website in a proper way.
